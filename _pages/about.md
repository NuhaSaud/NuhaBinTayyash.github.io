I am an Assistant Professor in the Information Technology Department at the College of Computing and Information Systems (CCIS), King Saud University. I completed my PhD at The University of Manchester in the UK, within the Computer Science Department of the College of Science and Engineering. My doctoral research focused on "Scalable Gaussian Process Modeling of Count Data from RNA-Sequencing Experiments." My research responsibilities have included the development and management of mathematical solutions utilizing AI and machine learning techniques, which I have successfully deployed as efficient software packages for analyzing RNA-sequencing data.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the CCIS at King Saud University, graduating with honors. My master’s thesis, titled "Erythemato-Squamous Diseases Classification," centered on exploring the performance of ensemble learning to aid decision-making in clinical systems. This research involved converting those decisions into rule-based models to provide doctors with comprehensive and easily interpretable results.

Additionally, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from the same college and university, also with honors. My undergraduate thesis, "Semi-Automated Object-Oriented System Analysis and Design (AutoUML) Tool," involved developing a tool to facilitate the system analysis and design process.

Highlights of my research interest:
======

My research interest is focused on developing innovative methods based on explainable and trustable AI, machine learning, causal inference and reinforcement learning to build computational models for addressing the pressing medical need and to understand cellular mechanisms, cell types, pathology, and molecular pathways, resulting from medical data analysis. I have advanced skills and knowledge in Probabilistic Machine Learning, Gaussian Process and sparse inference to model biological systems.

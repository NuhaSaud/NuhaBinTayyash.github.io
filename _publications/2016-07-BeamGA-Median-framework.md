Abstract 
BeamGA is a general hybrid heuristic framework that can be used to solve the median problem in comparative genomics, where any distance function can be used. It starts with a heuristic search approach (local beam search) in order to generate a number of solutions. Then a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to refine the solutions. It considers true biological evolution scenarios by applying the concept of common intervals during the GA optimization process.
